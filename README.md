### Hi there üëã

# üí´ About Me:
Multimedia and Digital Education<br><br>During my university studies, I took many digital education courses taught by Professor Chen Cheng-Huan, which sparked my strong interest in digital learning. I gradually built my own knowledge and skills in this field and learned XR production tools such as Kodu, CoSpaces, and MAKAR. I gained practical experience and guidance in these courses.<br><br>After joining Professor Chen Cheng-Huan's "Learning and Instructional Technology Research Group (LIT Research Group)", we not only received guidance for our graduation projects but also obtained many resources and competition information. This allowed me to actively participate in related research and competition activities and delve deeper into digital learning. For example, I participated in the "Digital Media Practical Competition" at the "2022 Taiwan Association of Educational Communications and Technology Annual Conference @NTUE International Academic Seminar (TAECT2022)" and won fourth place. I also participated in the National Science Council's research project "Activity design, script development, and effectiveness evaluation for supporting students' VR content co-creation learning activities in the post-pandemic era". I was fortunate to learn and create CoSpaces with my seniors and went to a primary school in Tainan to conduct an experiment on VR collaborative learning, further accumulating more related experience.<br><br>In addition, I had the opportunity to audit Professor Chan Chi-Shing's virtual reality course and learn Unity to build games and C# programming languages. Currently, I am developing a virtual reality digital education game using Meta Quest 2 provided by Professor Chen Cheng-Huan, and I hope to launch a game with gameplay, operability, interactivity, and situationality in the near future to meet the development trend of the metaverse.<br><br>Personal Traits<br><br>I believe I am a curious, actively learning, and daring person who pursues dreams. Since I had my own computer in elementary school, I began to learn various information-related knowledge and programming. This made me passionate about these topics. In high school, I established my own blog, learned PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and other technologies, deepening my understanding of website construction, and obtained relevant programming certificates in university. Besides pursuing information technology learning, I also love travel and adventure. During summer vacation, I fulfilled my long-cherished dream of cycling around Taiwan and recorded my cycling story on my personal website. I also spent a lot of effort on children's camps during winter and summer vacations, teaching APCS, Scratch programming, cycling, playing earth games, or building tree houses. Recently, I also volunteered as a children's companion reader at church, and all these experiences taught me how to interact with children.<br><br>In university, besides my major and interest in digital education, I also took courses in psychology, media studies, and entrepreneurship. I am an active learner who is not afraid to try new things and explore different fields.
